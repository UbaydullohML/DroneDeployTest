### DroneDeploy is a cloud-based software platform for commercial drones. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for planning, flying, processing, and analyzing drone data. DroneDeploy is used by businesses of all sizes in a wide range of industries, including construction, surveying, agriculture, and inspection.

### Here are some of the key features of the DroneDeploy platform:

- Mission planning: DroneDeploy provides a variety of tools for planning drone missions, such as flight path generation, obstacle avoidance, and airspace awareness.
- Data processing: DroneDeploy automatically processes drone data to create high-resolution maps, 3D models, and other outputs.
- Data analysis: DroneDeploy provides a variety of tools for analyzing drone data, including measurements, annotations, and change detection.
- Collaboration: DroneDeploy makes it easy to collaborate with others on drone projects by sharing data and maps.

### Here are some examples of how DroneDeploy is used in different industries:

- Construction: Construction companies use DroneDeploy to create progress reports, identify potential problems, and measure volumes of materials.
- Surveying: Surveyors use DroneDeploy to create maps and 3D models of land areas, construction sites, and other assets.
- Agriculture: Farmers use DroneDeploy to monitor crop health, assess damage, and manage irrigation.
- Inspection: Inspectors use DroneDeploy to inspect bridges, buildings, and other infrastructure for defects and damage.
- Real estate: Real estate agents use DroneDeploy to create aerial photos and videos of properties.
- Mining: Mining companies use DroneDeploy to track inventory, monitor operations, and create safety maps.


#### The WMPL file is a proprietary file format that DroneDeploy uses to store FLY mission information. The SDK that DroneDeploy is developing will allow developers to create applications that can read and execute WMPL files on existing drones.
