# DroneDeployTest

### DroneDeploy is a cloud-based software platform for commercial drones. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for planning, flying, processing, and analyzing drone data. DroneDeploy is used by businesses of all sizes in a wide range of industries, including construction, surveying, agriculture, and inspection.

### Here are some of the key features of the DroneDeploy platform:

- Mission planning: DroneDeploy provides a variety of tools for planning drone missions, such as flight path generation, obstacle avoidance, and airspace awareness.
- Data processing: DroneDeploy automatically processes drone data to create high-resolution maps, 3D models, and other outputs.
- Data analysis: DroneDeploy provides a variety of tools for analyzing drone data, including measurements, annotations, and change detection.
- Collaboration: DroneDeploy makes it easy to collaborate with others on drone projects by sharing data and maps.

### Here are some examples of how DroneDeploy is used in different industries:

- Construction: Construction companies use DroneDeploy to create progress reports, identify potential problems, and measure volumes of materials.
- Surveying: Surveyors use DroneDeploy to create maps and 3D models of land areas, construction sites, and other assets.
- Agriculture: Farmers use DroneDeploy to monitor crop health, assess damage, and manage irrigation.
- Inspection: Inspectors use DroneDeploy to inspect bridges, buildings, and other infrastructure for defects and damage.
- Real estate: Real estate agents use DroneDeploy to create aerial photos and videos of properties.
- Mining: Mining companies use DroneDeploy to track inventory, monitor operations, and create safety maps.


### WPML 

- The WPML file is a proprietary format that DroneDeploy uses to store FLY mission information. The SDK that DroneDeploy is developing will allow developers to create applications that can read and execute WPML files on existing drones.

- WPML files are generated by DroneDeploy's mission planning software when you create a FLY mission; the wpml file contains all of the information about the mission, such as the waypoints, speed, altitude, camera settings, and other DroneDeploy-specific settings.
- Usage: WPML files are used to control the drone's flight path and to collect data. The drone can read the wpml file and fly along the path defined in the file. WPML files are typically used to execute FLY missions, which are missions that are flown autonomously by the drone.

- WMPL file usage example, a construction company might use a WPML file to fly a drone over a construction site to create a map or 3D model.
- WMPL files control drone usage by providing it with the flight plan. The flight plan contains information about the waypoints that the drone should fly to, the speed at which it should fly, the altitude at which it should fly, and the camera settings that it should use.

#### Here is a more detailed explanation of how a WPML file controls the drone in usage:

- The drone controller reads the WPML file and loads the flight plan into its memory.
- The drone controller uses the flight plan to calculate the drone's current position and the next waypoint that it needs to fly to.
- The drone controller sends commands to the drone to control its speed and direction.
- The drone controller monitors the drone's position and makes adjustments to the commands as needed to ensure that the drone is flying along the planned path.

### KML 

- KMl files are more general-purpose file formats that can be used to store and share geospatial data. They are supported by a wide range of software like GIS, and web mapping services. It is ideal to share drone data with others or publish drone data online and visualize.
